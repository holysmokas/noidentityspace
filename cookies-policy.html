        <h2>What are Cookies?</h2>
        <p>Cookies are small pieces of data stored on your device (computer or mobile device) when you visit a website.
            They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
        <p>We use cookies for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> Necessary for the website to function correctly (e.g., security,
                network management).</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> To analyze how our visitors use the website (e.g., which pages are
                popular) so we can improve content and performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising Cookies (Third-Party):</strong> These cookies are set by third-party advertising
