            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> A lost or stolen smartphone is more than just an inconvenience—it's a
                potential goldmine for identity thieves. Your phone is the key to your email, banking, social media, and
                most critically, your Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). When your phone is gone, you have a critical
                window to protect your entire digital life. You need a **Lost Phone Protocol**.</p>

            
                

            <h2 id="step-1">Step 1: The Initial Lockout (5 Minutes)</h2>
            <p>Your first priority is a remote lockout and location attempt. Do this immediately from a trusted computer
                or another person's phone:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**iPhone:** Use the **Find My** app or website. Enable Lost Mode, which remotely locks the screen
                    with a passcode and can display a custom message with an alternative contact number.</li>
                <li>**Android:** Use the **Find My Device** app or website. Use the 'Secure Device' option to lock the
                    phone and sign out of your Google account.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Do not try to find the thief yourself.</strong> This is about digital security, not physical
                confrontation. If the phone is simply lost, this step is often enough for a good Samaritan to return it.
            </p>

            <h2 id="step-2">Step 2: Change Your Most Critical Passwords (15 Minutes)</h2>
            <p>Even if your phone is locked, a sophisticated thief might be able to bypass the lock screen. You must
                change the passwords for the apps most tied to your identity:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Primary Email (Gmail, Outlook):** This is the master key to everything else. Change it first.</li>
                <li>**Password Manager:** If you use one, changing the master password is critical.</li>
                <li>**Banking/Financial Apps:** Change the passwords for any mobile banking or payment apps (PayPal,
                    Venmo).</li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote>
                If a thief can access your email, they can reset the password for nearly every other account you own.
            </blockquote>

            
            
            <h2 id="step-3">Step 3: Call Your Carrier to Suspend Service (30 Minutes)</h2>
            <p>A thief can perform a **SIM swap attack** by using the information they find on your phone (like a
                driver's license photo) to convince your carrier to transfer your phone number to their device. This is
                how they bypass **SMS-based 2FA**.</p>
            <p>Call your carrier (Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T) immediately and request they **suspend your number** and
                place
                a **SIM port freeze** on your account. This prevents them from moving your number.</p>

            <h2 id="step-4">Step 4: Execute a Remote Wipe (If Necessary)</h2>
            <p>If you have confirmed the phone is stolen (not just lost) and you've completed the critical first three
                steps, perform a **remote factory reset** to wipe all data.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Wiping the phone usually disables location tracking. Only do this if you are sure
                you cannot recover the phone and data security is paramount.</p>

            <h2 id="step-5">Step 5: Notify Law Enforcement</h2>
            <p>File a police report and get a **police report number**. You will need this for insurance claims and to
                help prove identity theft if that occurs later.</p>

            <h2 id="step-6">Step 6: Revoke Access to App-Based 2FA</h2>
            <p>If you use an app like **Google Authenticator** or **Authy**, you need to revoke the phone's access. The
                method depends on the app:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Authy:** You can log into a new device and choose to remove the old, stolen device from your
                    account.</li>
                <li>**Google Authenticator:** This is harder. You must use the backup codes you saved when setting it up
                    to restore access on a new device. This is why having backup codes saved in a secure, non-phone
                    location (like a physical safe or an encrypted drive) is non-negotiable.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="step-7">Step 7: Prepare for a Credit Freeze</h2>
            <p>Although the phone theft itself doesn't mean credit fraud has occurred, the breach of your personal data
                (photos of IDs, tax documents, etc.) makes it a strong possibility. Be prepared to place a **credit
                freeze** with all three major bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) if you see any suspicious activity
                or your phone contained high-value PII.</p>
